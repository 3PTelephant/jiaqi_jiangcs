**Aerial Surveillance System with Multiple UAVs**
During the first year of my master study, I used a ground station based on C# to control two Parrot2 drones. Using the images captured by those drone, we can have a larger field of view.

The GUI of the ground station is shown below.

**Cooperative Ground Target Tracking with Multiple UAVs**
At the last year, I build a multiple UAVs platform with Bebop2 drones which was used for my master thesis.
